            Prodigy is an online math game and education platform that is used by millions of students, parents, and teachers across the world. Students log in to Prodigy's online game to play and learn math. Within Prodigy, students get to design their own wizard avatar and explore a massive online world. They encounter monsters and engage in â€˜math battles', where they must answer curriculum-aligned math questions in order to defeat their opponent. As students play, Prodigy is constantly adapting the educational content that they encounter, so that each student advances through the curriculum and succeeds at their own pace.
